After completing my training as an IT Systems Integration Specialist at OBI Services, I began a career as a DevOps Engineer at OBI Smart Technologies GmbH. My core competencies include cloud technologies, particularly Amazon Web Services (AWS) and the management of Kubernetes clusters.

In my current role as a Cloud DevOps Engineer, I support the development of our cloud platform. I specialize in Infrastructure as Code, container orchestration, and the implementation of CI/CD pipelines for modern cloud-native applications.
