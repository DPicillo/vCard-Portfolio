### 2. General Information on Data Processing

This website can be used without providing personal data.
No cookies are set, no analysis or tracking services are used, and no personal data is collected, stored or passed on.

### 3. Server Log Files

When accessing the website, information is automatically processed by the web server (or the Content Delivery Network from AWS CloudFront).
These server log files may contain the following data:

- IP address (shortened or anonymized, as far as technically possible)
- Date and time of access
- File or page accessed
- Amount of data transferred
- Browser type and version
- Operating system

The processing is carried out exclusively to ensure the technical operation and system security of the website (Art. 6 Para. 1 lit. f GDPR).
This data is not combined with other data sources.

### 4. Use of AWS CloudFront (Content Delivery Network)

This website uses the Content Delivery Network (CDN) Amazon CloudFront, a service of
Amazon Web Services EMEA SARL, 38 avenue John F. Kennedy, L-1855 Luxembourg.

CloudFront serves to deliver website content quickly and securely.
For technical reasons, this may result in the transmission of data (e.g. IP addresses) to AWS servers.
This processing is based on Art. 6 Para. 1 lit. f GDPR (legitimate interest in the efficient and secure provision of the website).

AWS is certified under the EU-US Data Privacy Framework (DPF), which ensures an adequate level of data protection.

The responsible authority is, for example, the State Commissioner for Data Protection and Freedom of Information North Rhine-Westphalia (LDI NRW).
